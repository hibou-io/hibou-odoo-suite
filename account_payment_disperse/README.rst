Hibou - Manually Disperse Payments
**********************************

What happens when a vendor pays you and the payment needs to be split 
between multiple invoices? What happens when partial payment needs to 
be applied to some or all of those invoices? We've got you covered.

For more information and add-ons, visit `Hibou.io <https://hibou.io/>`_.


=============
Main Features
=============

* Ability to disperse payment manually.
* Choose to leave an open balance or write-off the difference.
* Easily pay only the portion of the balance that is currently due (or due before a specific date).
* **Remaining Column** that displays the residual balance.
* **Due Date** cutoff field (defaults to current date).
* **Due Column** which displays current amount due. This recalculates when the due date cutoff is changed.
* New buttons to easily fill or pre-populate amount remaining or amount due.
* Tests to ensure that all the stock payment mechanisms work, and that we make the right reconciliations.
